Project: App to calculate budgets from individuals based on their incomes & expenses

Project Planning: 

App will require => 
 			=> Input data (income & expenses) through JS function [ Events handler/ listener]

			=> Populated data will be saved [Get input values from user]
	
			=> Sort & Save data (Data structure)
		
			=> Update UI

			=> Update Global budget.


All them task needs to be classified in modules for arquitechtural & security reasons (against hackers): 

 			=> UI Module will encapsulate:  
				
							- Populated data [Get input values/data] (Task 2)
							- Update UI (Task 4)
							
			=> DATA Module will encapsulate:

							- Sort & Save data from input fields (Task 3)
							- Update the Global Budget (Task 5)

			=> CONTROLLER Module will take care:
					
							- Events handler / listener.... (Task 1)
